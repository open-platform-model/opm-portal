# 01-live-cluster-capture: OPM portal V1

Status: Concluded

## Hypothesis

The status, inventory, label and event shapes a released opm-operator writes on a live cluster are enough for a read-only portal to show applied state, workload health, the instance graph and a recent-activity feed without re-rendering any module, and the portal design read from source alone matches what the operator actually writes.

## Setup

A throwaway kind cluster (`opm-portal-probe`, Kubernetes v1.36.1, podman provider), created for this capture and deleted afterwards. Never the shared development or dogfood clusters.

- CLI v1.0.0-beta.7 (checksum verified) installed opm-operator v1.0.0-beta.5 from its release manifest.
- The Platform subscribed `opmodel.dev/catalogs/opm@v4` at 4.5.2 and went Ready in about 3 s.
- Inputs applied, copied into [`inputs/`](inputs/) (no Secret data in any of them):
  - `mi-cert-manager.yaml`: `opmodel.dev/modules/cert_manager@v2` v2.0.5, cluster-scoped kinds, CRDs and webhooks. First under the operator's own ServiceAccount, then with `cert-manager-applier.yaml` naming a cluster-admin applier ServiceAccount.
  - `mi-podinfo.yaml`: `testing.opmodel.dev/modules/operator/podinfo@v0` v0.1.11 with a namespaced applier ServiceAccount. Used for the scripted image break.
  - `tregs.yaml`: two hand-applied TransformerRegistrations, each exercising a refusal verdict. No published provider module rendered one at capture time.
  - `mp-noflux.yaml`: a ModulePackage on a cluster without Flux, exercising the missing-source state only.
  - `web-cli-owned/`: a CLI-owned instance of `opmodel.dev/modules/web_app@v1` v1.0.5, applied with `opm instance apply` (owner-approved, throwaway cluster only).
- Scripted break: the podinfo ModuleInstance's `values.image.tag` patched to a tag that does not exist, so the operator applied the bad image (instance generation 1 to 2); sampled every 2 s until `ProgressDeadlineExceeded`. The two old replicas kept running and serving while the new Pod failed to pull, which is why the Deployment's `Available=True` stayed truthful.
- Phases 7 to 9, on a second throwaway cluster (`opm-portal-f1`, same versions, deleted afterwards): a backup provider fixture set (catalog, provider module and consumer module at 0.1.0, from opm-operator PR 212, branch `test/add-active-provider-fixture`) served from a local registry mapped for `testing.opmodel.dev` only. Phase 7 ran the released operator v1.0.0-beta.5; phases 8 and 9 ran opm-operator `main` at 40a2345 rebuilt with library v1.0.0-beta.4, which is not a release.

[`capture.sh`](capture.sh) is the snapshot script for phases 1 to 6, with the scratch paths replaced by environment variables. It never reads Secrets: the all-objects listing excludes them by resource name. Phases 7 to 9 were snapshotted by hand with the same `kubectl get` calls, limited to the OPM kinds, events and the consumer's rendered objects.

## Run

```bash
# against a throwaway cluster only; the script refuses any other context
KUBECONFIG_FILE=<throwaway kubeconfig> OUT_ROOT=./out ./capture.sh phase3-healthy
```

The full snapshots (all OPM CRs, every events.k8s.io/v1 event, all non-Secret objects, workload ownership chains, the operator log, about 12 MB across nine phases) stayed outside the repo. [`samples/`](samples/) holds a trimmed subset: `managedFields`, the `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation and `spec.values` are removed from every object, status histories are cut to one or two entries, and inventories to the first few entries.

| Sample | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `mi-apply-failed.yaml` | `Ready=False/ApplyFailed`, `Reconciling=True`, no inventory and no `lastAppliedAt`, but `requiredContracts` already set; failed history entries carry `message` and no `phase`; `failureCounters.drift` climbing on the failure |
| `mi-podinfo-healthy.yaml`, `mi-podinfo-image-broken.yaml` | the same instance before and one minute after the image break: operator status identical in kind (`Ready=True/ReconciliationSucceeded`), only the digests and history move |
| `pods-image-broken.txt`, `break-timeline-excerpt.txt` | the new Pod in `ErrImagePull` / `ImagePullBackOff` while the Deployment stays `Available=True` and the instance stays `Ready=True` until `ProgressDeadlineExceeded`, about 600 s later |
| `events-operator-podinfo.yaml` | operator events (`opm-controller`) for podinfo: each repeat a separate event with no `series` |
| `events-operator-series.yaml` | the only operator events that carry `series` (`count: 2`): two Platform `Generated` and one backup-provider `NoOp` repeat, each about an unchanged object, all from the unreleased library beta.4 rebuild |
| `events-kubelet-image-pull.yaml` | kubelet events with `eventTime: null`, counted through `deprecatedCount` and `deprecatedLastTimestamp` |
| `mi-cli-owned.yaml` | `spec.owner: cli`, `Ready=Unknown/ManagedExternally`, an inventory the CLI wrote, no `requiredContracts` |
| `platform-fresh.yaml` | `ContractsFulfilled=False/UnfulfilledContracts` on a fresh install with two provider-fulfilled contracts nobody implements |
| `treg-catalog-unresolved.yaml`, `treg-refusals.yaml` | hand-applied refusals: `Stalled=True` plus `Ready=False` with the same reason (`CatalogUnresolved`, `ProvidesMismatch`, `ProviderMismatch`); no `status.accepted`, no `status.active`, no `Active` condition |
| `treg-rendered-refused-beta5.yaml` | phase 7: the claim the provider module rendered, with the bare `0.1.0` the opm catalog's transformer writes, refused `CatalogUnresolved` by the released beta.5 operator |
| `treg-accepted-active.yaml`, `platform-registration-entry.yaml`, `mi-backup-consumer-ready.yaml` | phase 8: the same claim with `status.accepted: true`, `status.active: true`, `Ready=True/Accepted` and `Active=True/ProviderReady`; the Platform's registry lists the catalog with `source: Registration`; the consumer is Ready with one ConfigMap the provider catalog's transformer rendered |
| `treg-removal-blocked.yaml` | phase 9: the claim deleted while the consumer still demands its contract: `Stalled=True` plus `Ready=False`, reason `DependentsRemain`, while `status.accepted` and `status.active` stay true and `Active=True` stays |

## Outcome

Measured on the live cluster. Fourteen observations, each correcting or confirming a claim the design had read from source:

1. **The default install cannot deploy a module with cluster-scoped objects.** cert-manager went `ApplyFailed` under the operator's ServiceAccount (cannot patch CRDs) and Ready once `serviceAccountName` named a cluster-admin applier. ApplyFailed is a state the portal must render: `Reconciling=True`, `Ready=False`, no inventory, no `lastAppliedAt`, `requiredContracts` already written.
2. **`status.requiredContracts` lists every contract the render used** (15 for cert-manager, 7 for podinfo), mostly catalog-fulfilled ones. It is not the set of provider contracts the instance demands, so it cannot draw "requires a provider" edges.
3. **An image-pull failure does not reach kstatus Failed until the progress deadline.** The new Pod sat in `ErrImagePull` / `ImagePullBackOff` from the first second, the Deployment stayed `Available=True` and kstatus said InProgress for about 600 s, and the operator's Ready stayed True throughout. Only a Pod-level waiting reason shows the break within seconds.
4. **Operator events carry `series` only when a repeat regards the same object version.** Across phases 1 to 9 the only operator events with `series` are three, each `series: {count: 2}` and a repeat seconds apart about an unchanged object: two Platform `Generated` events and one ModuleInstance `NoOp` event for backup-provider. All three came from the unreleased library beta.4 rebuild; the first sits in the phase 7 snapshot only because that snapshot was taken after the rebuild started. No event from the released beta.5 controller carries `series`. cert-manager's four `ApplyFailed` repeats in phases 1 to 6 have identical reason, action, note and reporting instance and came 11 to 25 s apart, yet are four separate events with no `series`: they differ only in the regarded object's `resourceVersion` (1090, 1111, 1191, 1221), which is part of the recorder's deduplication key, because the instance object changed between retries. Phases 1 to 6 had no NoOp events; phases 7 to 9 had `NoOp` events from reconciles that changed nothing. Kubelet events have `eventTime: null` and are counted through the deprecated count and timestamp fields. A feed has to fold repeats with and without `series` itself.
5. **Events about the cluster-scoped Platform and TransformerRegistration land in namespace `default`.**
6. **`failureCounters.drift` climbs on healthy instances.** The operator's drift dry-run runs as its own ServiceAccount and ignores `spec.serviceAccountName` (opm-operator issue 209). The counters are not a health signal.
7. **`regarding.*`, `reason` and `type` field selectors work server-side** on events.k8s.io/v1 at 1.36.
8. **ReplicaSets and Pods carry `module-instance.opmodel.dev/name` and `component.opmodel.dev/name`**, but not the uuid label. All 44 operator-owned inventory objects carry the uuid label, and none has an ownerReference to its ModuleInstance.
9. **Registration state is in `status.accepted` and `status.active`, not in the condition pair.** A refusal is `Stalled=True` plus `Ready=False` with the same reason, no `accepted` or `active` field and no `Active` condition. But a registration whose removal is blocked (phase 9) shows the same condition pair, reason `DependentsRemain`, while `accepted` and `active` stay true. And the released beta.5 operator refuses every claim the opm catalog's transformer renders: the transformer writes the bare SemVer `0.1.0`, which library v1.0.0-beta.1 rejects as not well formed, so the claim is `CatalogUnresolved` (phase 7, opm-operator issue 210). Library PR 170 canonicalises the version; it first shipped in library v1.0.0-beta.2. The phase 8 operator, built on library v1.0.0-beta.4, accepted the same claim. The hand-applied claims, written with a `v` prefix, got past version parsing to other verdicts. Issue 210 was closed by opm-operator PR 213, which bumps the operator to library v1.0.0-beta.4; the fix takes effect in the next operator release, and until then no released operator accepts a rendered claim.
10. **History entries are `{action: reconcile, phase: complete}` on success; failed entries carry `message` and no phase.** The operator keeps at most ten entries (five were present in the largest snapshot), so a failing instance's retries push older successes out after ten attempts.
11. **`ContractsFulfilled=False/UnfulfilledContracts` is normal on a fresh Platform.** A portal that paints it red alarms every new install.
12. **A request-path graph is too slow.** Serving cert-manager's graph live took 7.4 to 9.4 s: about 45 GETs at client-go's default 5 queries per second. A watch-fed cache is required, not an optimisation.
13. **cert-manager's graph has 86 nodes and 85 edges**, 20 of them component nodes, most holding one RBAC or config object. Unreadable without grouping.
14. **The last-applied annotation copies the full `spec.values`** whenever an instance is applied with client-side `kubectl apply`. Hiding values means stripping that annotation too.

Phases 7 to 9 added the registration states portal:D4 shows: refused, accepted and active, and removal blocked (observation 9). Two further facts from the CLI-owned instance: the CLI stamps `module-instance.opmodel.dev/namespace` and `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: opm-cli` on the ModuleInstance it writes, and the operator emits one `ManagedExternally` event for it. A ModulePackage without Flux sat at `Ready=False/SourceNotReady`, retried every 60 s.

Sizes: the cert-manager ModuleInstance is 14.6 KB (status 12.6 KB, inventory 6.3 KB at about 148 B per entry, history 4.1 KB for five entries); podinfo is 3.4 KB.

Not captured: a working ModulePackage (needs Flux and a pushed artifact), and an accepted, active registration on a released operator: phase 8 ran an unreleased build, because no released operator carries library v1.0.0-beta.2 or later yet (opm-operator `main` pins library v1.0.0-beta.4 since PR 213; release PR 208, 1.0.0-beta.6, is open).

**Hypothesis held, with corrections.** The operator's status, inventory and labels carry enough for applied state, the instance graph and a feed without any render, but health needs a Pod-level rule (3), contract demand is not recorded (2), events need deduplication (4, 5), and the cache tier is mandatory (12). These corrections are folded into portal:D3, portal:D4, portal:D8 and portal:D9 ([DESIGN.md](../../../DESIGN.md)).
